## Project Description

Welcome to the Python - Async Comprehension project! This project focuses on asynchronous comprehensions and generators. It is designed to help you understand and work with these concepts effectively.

**Project Lead**: Emmanuel Turlay, Staff Software Engineer at Cruise

**Project Weight**: 1

**Score**: Your score will be updated as you progress.

### Resources

For this project, you are encouraged to read or watch the following resources:

- [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)
- [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#asynchronous-comprehensions)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.AsyncGenerator)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Team

This project can be completed individually or as a team. Feel free to collaborate if you wish!

## Requirements

**General**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
