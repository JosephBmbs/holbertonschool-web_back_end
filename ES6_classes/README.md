## Introduction

Welcome to the "ES6 Classes" project! In this project, we will explore the concept of classes in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which introduced a more structured and intuitive way to define objects and their behavior in JavaScript.

## About ES6 Classes

ES6 classes are a fundamental feature introduced in ECMAScript 6, providing a more organized and familiar way to work with objects in JavaScript. Classes allow you to define the blueprint for objects, encapsulate data, and specify their behavior through methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of ES6 classes and their core concepts. You will be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the need for external references:

- How to define a class in ES6.
- Adding methods to a class to define its behavior.
- The purpose and implementation of static methods within a class.
- Extending a class to create a new class with additional features.
- An introduction to metaprogramming and symbols.

## Resources

To excel in this project, take advantage of the following resources:

- [Classes](https://example.com/es6-classes)
- [Metaprogramming](https://example.com/es6-metaprogramming)

## Requirements

To ensure a successful learning experience, please adhere to the following project requirements:

- All your code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors include vi, vim, emacs, and Visual Studio Code.
- All project files should end with a new line.
- A mandatory `README.md` file, located at the root of the project folder, is required.
- Use the .js extension for your code files.
- Testing will be performed using Jest, and you can run tests with the `npm run test` command.
- Code linting will be conducted using ESLint, and you can verify the entire project with `npm run full-test`.

## Setup

To get started, follow these setup instructions:

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:
   - Run the following commands in your home directory:
     ```shell
     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
     sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
     sudo apt install nodejs -y
     nodejs -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint:
   - In your project directory, run the following commands:
     ```shell
     npm install --save-dev jest
     npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
     npm install --save-dev eslint
     ```
