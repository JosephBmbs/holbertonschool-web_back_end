## Introduction

Welcome to the "ES6 Basics" project! In this project, we will dive into the fundamentals of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language standard. ES6 introduced several new features and enhancements that have significantly improved JavaScript's capabilities and readability.

## About ECMAScript 6 (ES6)

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language. It introduced a wide range of new features and improvements, making JavaScript more powerful and developer-friendly. Some of the key concepts covered in this project include:

- Statements and declarations in ES6.
- Arrow functions, a concise way to define functions.
- Default parameters for function arguments.
- The rest parameter, allowing functions to accept a variable number of arguments.
- Iterables and iterators for working with collections.
- String templating, making string interpolation more intuitive.
- Block-scoped variables and constants.
- Object creation and property enhancements in ES6.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of ES6 and its core concepts. You will be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the need for external references:

- What ES6 is and why it's important in modern JavaScript development.
- The new features introduced in ES6 and their practical applications.
- The distinction between constants and variables in ES6.
- The concept of block-scoped variables and how they differ from traditional JavaScript variables.
- The use of arrow functions and their default parameters.
- Working with rest and spread function parameters.
- Utilizing string templating for more expressive string manipulation.
- Creating objects and managing their properties using ES6 syntax.
- Understanding the concept of iterators and implementing for-of loops.
