## Resources

Before diving into the project, consider referring to the following resources:

- [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](link_to_resource1)
- [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](link_to_resource2)
- [random.uniform](link_to_resource3)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, one should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **async and await Syntax**: Understanding how to use these keywords to create asynchronous code blocks.
- **Executing Async Programs with asyncio**: Knowing how to start and manage asynchronous programs using Python's asyncio library.
- **Running Concurrent Coroutines**: Exploring techniques to execute multiple coroutines concurrently, improving efficiency.
- **Creating asyncio Tasks**: Mastering the art of creating asyncio tasks for asynchronous execution.
- **Using the Random Module**: Harnessing the power of the random module for generating random values.

## Requirements

### General

- **README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- **Editors**: Allowed editors for coding are vi, vim, or emacs.
- **Python Version**: All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- **New Line**: Ensure that all files end with a new line.
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.
- **File Length**: The length of files will be tested using `wc`.
- **Shebang**: The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **Code Style**: Code should adhere to the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x).
- **Type Annotations**: All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- **Documentation for Modules**: All modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- **Documentation for Functions**: All functions should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).

Please note that documentation should consist of complete sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method, and the length of the documentation will be verified.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## Async and Await

Python's `async` and `await` syntax enable writing asynchronous code blocks. Learn how to leverage these keywords effectively.

## Using asyncio

The `asyncio` library is a powerful tool for managing asynchronous tasks. Discover how to use it to create and control asynchronous programs.

## Running Concurrent Coroutines

Concurrency is key in asynchronous programming. Explore techniques for running multiple coroutines concurrently, improving code performance.

## Creating asyncio Tasks

Master the creation of asyncio tasks, allowing efficient management and execution of asynchronous operations.

## Using the Random Module

The `random` module provides functions for generating random values. Learn how to use it to introduce randomness into asynchronous programs.

## Best Practices

Throughout this project, we'll adhere to best practices in Python development, including type annotations, documentation, and code style.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, one will have a solid grasp of asynchronous programming in Python, well-prepared to build high-performance, non-blocking applications. Happy coding!
