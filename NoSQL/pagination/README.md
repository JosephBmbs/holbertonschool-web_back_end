## Introduction

This project explores the concept of pagination in the context of designing a RESTful API. Pagination is a critical aspect of web development when dealing with large datasets, ensuring efficient and user-friendly access to information.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Implement pagination using simple page and page_size parameters.
- Design a paginated dataset with hypermedia metadata.
- Understand how to implement pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the following concepts and resources:

- [REST API Design: Pagination](https://example.com/rest-api-pagination-guide)
- [HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State)](https://example.com/hateoas-explanation)

## Requirements

To ensure the success of this project, please adhere to the following requirements:

- All project files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- You must include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` style guidelines (version 2.5.*).
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules should include documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- Documentation should be more than just a single word; it should be a meaningful sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
